todo:
*** fix /tv/aws/index
* saved games show up as "killed by $lastMonst"
    * how does TVTOOL see saved games?
* list filter
* amiga games are much bigger. don't record them for now. it also totally doesn't work...
- put a size limit on uploads in the lambda
- VIDEO.WRITETOS3() <- TODO this could be be basis of cloud savegames too
- hold inventory views (and others?) for a little longer somehow?

live mode:
- use smaller batches only when someone is watching
- write batches every few seconds when someone is watching
- have a diff file if game is ongoing?
- page with list of running games

bugs:
-
