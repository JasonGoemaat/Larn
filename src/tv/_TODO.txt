bugs:
*** saving a game 3(?) from the end of a buffer causes a null patch, then error on reload
- scrolling on safari is wonky. seems to be easier when paused
- probably need to await fonts loading on replay
- modern font is too wide on replay

todo:
- set lastframe.id to something interesting in realtime mode
- Save playback speed via cookie
- Link from watch screen back to list
* amiga games are much bigger. don't record them for now. it also totally doesn't work...
- compress completed games into a single large file, or a few larger files

- put a size limit on uploads in the lambda
- VIDEO.WRITETOS3() <- TODO this could be basis of cloud savegames too
- hold inventory views (and others?) for a little longer somehow?
- clean up s3/dynamo boilerplate

live mode:
- use smaller batches only when someone is watching
- write batches every few seconds when someone is watching
- have a diff file if game is ongoing?
- page with list of running games
