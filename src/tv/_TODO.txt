todo:
* clear up old games
* if < N frames, delete
* list filter
* amiga games are much bigger. don't record them for now. it also totally doesn't work...
- don't add saved games to viewing list
- preserve games that make it to the scoreboard
- resize font to fill screen
- add "Watch This Game" to top of high score stats or beside high scores list (filter by version #)
- put a size limit on uploads in the lambda
- VIDEO.WRITETOS3() <- TODO this could be be basis of cloud savegames too
- add link to larn tv from scoreboard 
- hold inventory views (and others?) for a little longer somehow?

live mode:
- use smaller batches only when someone is watching
- write batches every few seconds when someone is watching
- have a diff file if game is ongoing?
- page with list of running games

bugs:
-
