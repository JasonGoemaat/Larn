bugs:
*** saving a game 3(?) from the end of a buffer causes a null patch, then error on reload
- scrolling on safari is wonky. seems to be easier when paused
- scrolling while loading isn't accurate (probably because it's using framebuffer.length)
- if you step past the end of a game (ie on speed 8) frames keep advancing
- probably need to await fonts loading on replay
- modern font is too wide on replay

todo:
* don't record intro frames with blinking cursor
* list filter
* amiga games are much bigger. don't record them for now. it also totally doesn't work...
- put a size limit on uploads in the lambda
- VIDEO.WRITETOS3() <- TODO this could be be basis of cloud savegames too
- hold inventory views (and others?) for a little longer somehow?
- clean up s3/dynamo boilerplate

live mode:
- use smaller batches only when someone is watching
- write batches every few seconds when someone is watching
- have a diff file if game is ongoing?
- page with list of running games

- divs[]
- uncompressedFormat???

bundle
- id
