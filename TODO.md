bugs:
- red wizard demon prince bug?
- half speed monsters don't move with HAS?
- can't load most recent game if you go to scoreboard too fast
- warn if changing names because it's annoying on the scoreboard
- arrow buttons on help screen are truncated in amiga mode
- player killed with range spell should drop gold/items beside corpse, not player
- take and a few other commands use a turn even if nothing is there to be taken
- quit doesn't work?
- amiga mode: viewing scoreboard resets to classic mode (partially fixed)
- last local game shows as winner and loser
- better inventory layout, font selection with react?
- no recovery if scoreboard hangs when loading
- scoreboard request from parse can probably be done as one request
  - should just have a dedicated scoreboard table
- amiga mode: strikethrough missing on taxes owing after victory
- blindness
  - black tile when opening door when blind
  - when blind, a monster from an unknown tile will reveal the tile its standing on during attack
- rothe/poltergeist/vampire are born awake -> should they move during stealth?
- monster movement isn't shown after falling asleep
- casting sph twice in the same direction will always kill the player
