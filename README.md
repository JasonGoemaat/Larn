     1. Introduction
     ---------------

     LARN is a dungeon type adventure game similar in concept to HACK, ROGUE
     or MORIA, but with a different feel and winning criteria.  LARN was
     released for the UNIX environment in 1986 by Noah Morgan.  It was
     subsequently ported to the MS-DOS environment by Don Kneller.  Kevin
     Routley has been working on enhancements to LARN on and off for the
     past two years. This version should work on most modern web browers.

       history.txt       Changes made since LARN V12.2.




     6. Command line options
     -----------------------

     There are several command line options that can modify the behavior of
     LARN. You can run these through larn.bat as well. The options are:

       -s             Show scores.

       -i             Show all scores including the inventories of dead
                      players.

       -#             Where # is a number from 0 to 9.  This sets the
                      difficulty of LARN to this level.  Normally, LARN
                      starts out with difficulty 0 and increases in
                      difficulty by 1 when you win at the current level.
                      Thus the game automatically gets more difficult.

       -h             A help screen that shows the command line arguments.


     7. WIZARD mode
     --------------

     There is a WIZARD mode for testing features of the game.  To get into
     WIZARD mode, type in an underscore "_" and answer the prompt for the
     password with REDACTED (do not enter the quotes).  Wizards are
     non-scoring characters that get enlightenment, everlasting expanded
     awareness and one of every object in the game.


     8. History and Other Information
     --------------------------------

     Noah Morgan originally created LARN 12.0 and released the UNIX
     version to the USENET in 1986.  Don Kneller ported the UNIX
     version to MSDOS (both IBM PCs and DEC Rainbows).

     Kevin Routley contributed various LARN enhancements. Version 12.1 had
     a limited distribution. Version 12.2 was distributed to the Usenet
     community. Version 12.3 was the last version released by Kevin.

	 Someone made 12.4 through 12.4.2, possibly copx according to
	 roguebasin. Edwin Denicholas took 12.4 alpha 2 and caressed it into
	 12.4.3 for Win32.

     Other editions of Larn have been distributed by others, namely
     LARN13 and Ultra-Larn.

     I hope you enjoy this version of LARN.
